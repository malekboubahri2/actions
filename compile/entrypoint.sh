# LAUNCH COMPILATION -----------------------------------------------------------

cd "${CMSIS_DIR}/Include"

# Get the different devices' part-numbers from the header filenames

#  NOTE: grep options, -P 'pattern is a Perl regex', -o 'to extract only words matching the pattern instead of the whole line'
